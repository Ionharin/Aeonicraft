A spiritual successor and redesign for Clockwork Phase.

(Currently in early development stage)

## Design Goal

A pseudo-science mod focusing on the storage and usage of compressed time (and other similarly nonsensical concepts). The primary progression will be a mix of mass resource-gathering, a somewhat familiar tech tree, and unique gameplay mechanics.

## Planned Features

### Temporal Compression

In the world of Minecraft, time does not flow consistently. Instead, it lies dormant throughout most of the world: 'unloaded chunks.' While most of the world is frozen here, there is one exception: the Aeon Pearl. This flower is made of a unique material which attracts dormant time, while repelling flowing time, causing them to only grow in unloaded chunks.

By harvesting these fully grown flowers, they can be harvested and processed into a usable material, then built into machines that work in the same manner: sucking up dormant time from unloaded chunks.

The simplest form of this would be a humble Temporal Compressor, compressing dormant time into a form known as Temporal Compression, or TC. Machines and tools built with this temporal material can then use this TC to speed up, or even burst, time forward.
