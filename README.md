# Aeonicraft

The spiritual successor to the Clockwork Phase series of mods.

Aeonicraft is a Minecraft Mod which adds a new form of magic energy called Temporal Compression (TC). This is spent to instantly complete otherwise slow or grindy tasks like mining or fishing.

This mod focuses heavily on visual effects and add-on content with other mods. Progression can be gained either directly by focusing on Aeonicraft gameplay, or indirectly, through Minecraft's advancement system. This way, Aeonicraft can act either as a standalone experience, or a companion to the gameplay of other mods (especially mods that add their own custom advancements).

Currently a work-in-progress.
